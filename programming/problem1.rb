# "Hello, World!" Challenge
=begin
	I wanted to write a program in Ruby that would print "Hello, world!", but it is instead printing "Hi, world!". Would you mind fixing this problem?
	
	The first person to do so in the correct way and create a PR for it would be eligible for his/her PR to be merged.
=end
puts "Hello, world!"
